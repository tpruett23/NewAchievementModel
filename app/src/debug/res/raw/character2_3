Holland: There's someone in a hammock between some trees!
Holland: Hey! Hey!
[Rustling...]
The hammock began to move... but it looks like the person is still asleep.
Holland: Do you mind helping me yell?
Help Holland yell!
<Wait 5>
Unnamed Character: What?...
Unnamed Character: Wait... Why am I in a hammock?
Holland: Oliver?
Oliver: Holland?
Holland: What are you doing up there?
Oliver: You know, apparently just sleeping in between some trees.
Holland: You disappeared last night... I was worried.
Oliver: Yeah, I'm confused about how I got here too...
[Oliver climbs down one of the trees and steps in front of everyone.]
